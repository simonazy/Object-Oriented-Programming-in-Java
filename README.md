# Object Oriented Programming in Java

This repo is to store notes and assignments complised in the *Object Oriented Programming in Java* class provided by UCSD on Cousera.[Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/home/welcome).

### Week 1
* Motivate the use of classes and objects in programming
* Create objects and call methods on them
* Describe member variables, methods and constructors
* Explain how to overload methods in Java and why overloading methods is useful 
* Describe the meaning of the keywords public and private and their effect on where variables can be accessed. 

### Week 2
* Select and effectively use Java documentation
* Generate visual maps using Java code and the Unfolding Maps libraries
* Create and draw memory models for reasoning about variable values for primitive and object data types
* Apply the basic rules for variable scope and explain how it impacts your code
* Practice tracing code using memory models and Java's rules for variable scope

### Week 3
* Create and manipulate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
* Find and effectively use Java documentation
* Use the Processing library in your programs
* Customize visual maps using Java code
* Use Java to read and parse data files 
* Organize data into appropriate objects 
* Describe and use the List data type and the ArrayList class
* Describe and use the Map data type 

### Week 4
* Explain the value of inheritance as a feature in object oriented programming languages   
* Use the keyword extends 
* Explain the relationship between a superclass and a subclass
* Use UML Diagrams to display class hierarchies   
* Explain an “is-a” relationship between classes 
* Describe how Java object construction occurs from the inside out 
* Use same-class and superclass constructors in class creation 
* Create methods which override from a superclass 
* Contrast method overloading and method overriding 
* Explain the purpose of polymorphism
* Step through decisions made at compile time and runtime 
* Use casting of objects to aid the compiler 
* Use the keyword "abstract" 
* Compare and contrast “inheritance of implementation” and “inheritance of interface” 
* Decide between Abstract Classes and Interfaces  

### Week 5
* Distinguish between Abstract Classes and Interfaces
* Analyze event-driven code
* Explain how mouse-clicks and keyboard input interact with the program execution
* Design user-interface elements
* Write code to implement a button and respond to mouse events
* Describe inheritance relationships used in the course so far
* Distinguish between interfaces and classes in this hierarchy
